		<h2>Minecraft Mods</h2>
		<p>I have been making mods with Minecraft Forge since around 2013 and they are my most successful projects. Click the links for more information:</p>
		<ul>
		    <li>
				<h3><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/floocraft">Floocraft</a></h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Brings the concept of Floo Powder, from the Harry Potter franchise, into Minecraft</li>
					<li>Players build fireplaces to teleport to and from, which are connected to the Floo Network using Floo Signs</li>
					<li>Floo Powder, when thrown into fire, turns it green and allows the user to walk in and teleport, or peek into the fire and see what's on the other side</li>
					<li>Floo Torches are torches which emit green light and cause random short-range teleportation on contact</li>
					<li>Floower Pots consume Floo Powder to automatically transform nearby fires in fireplaces</li>
				</ul>

				<h3><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fragile-glass-and-thin-ice">Fragile Glass and Thin Ice</a></h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Normal glass blocks in Minecraft can't be broken through by running, falling or projectiles. This mod can change that</li>
					<li>Fragile Glass blocks are made with sugar water in a special cauldron</li>
					<li>Thin Ice blocks generate in patches on frozen water and break underfoot if an entity is moving too fast</li>
					<li>Weak Stone patches generate on cave ceilings and crumble into gravel on contact</li>
					<li>Users can use config files to configure:
					<ul>
						<li>What entities can break blocks on collision</li>
						<li>How fast such entities need to be travelling to break them</li>
						<li>What blocks can be triggered on collision</li>
						<li>How fast an entity needs to be moving to successfully collide</li>
						<li>The behaviour of the block on collision (not limited to breaking!)</li>
					</ul>	
				</ul>

				<h3><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rocket-squids">Rocket Squids</a></h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Rocket Squids are uncommon and spawn in water in the overworld</li>
					<li>The explosive properties of their ink can propel them great distances</li>
					<li>The Whistling Conch, a playable instrument, can be found on seashores</li>
					<li>Rocket Squids have a growing lore and set of interactions with different items - experimentation is encouraged</li>
				</ul>

				<h3><a href="https://fredtargaryen.github.io/erc.html">ExRollerCoaster (port for Minecraft 1.12.2)</a></h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Adds new rails which bend at any angle in any direction, and the coaster follows them</li>
					<li>Rails have various properties such as branching, redstone acceleration, invisibility or maintaining constant coaster velocity</li>
					<li>The player camera twists and turns with the coaster (this is work-in-progress in the port)</li>
				</ul>
				GIF TBD
