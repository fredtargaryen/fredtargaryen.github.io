	    <h1>ExRollerCoaster</h1>
        <p>This is not an original mod, but a port of an existing one. The original ExRollerCoaster was made by a Japanese developer known as tera_motty for Minecraft 1.7.10, and it looks like it will stay that way. I am working on porting it to Minecraft 1.12.2 so it can be enjoyed in a more modern Minecraft game.</p>
		<h2>Download the Port</h2>
		<p>To download the mod please choose between one of two versions:</p>
		<ul>
		    <li>
			    <h3><a href="https://fredtargaryen.github.io/files/ExRollerCoaster-1.5.1.jar?raw=true">Download ExRollerCoaster</a></h3>
				<p>A simple port to 1.12.2 which aims to be as faithful to the original as possible.</p>

			</li>
			<li>
			    <h3><a href="https://fredtargaryen.github.io/files/ExRollerCoaster-1.5.1-extra.jar?raw=true">Download ExRollerCoaster Extra</a></h3>
				<p>This port will contain extra changes and features that I believe improve the quality of the mod. Currently, this version includes an entry ticket item.</p>

		</ul>
		<p>Please note that the two versions are incompatible with each other, and clients must have the same version as the server.</p>
