	    <h1>ExRollerCoaster</h1>
        <p>This is not an original mod, but a port of an existing one. The original ExRollerCoaster was made for Minecraft 1.7.10 by <a href="https://twitter.com/tera_motty">this person</a>; they plan to eventually move to a more modern Minecraft version but this port is here in the meantime.</p>
		<p>I ported it to Minecraft 1.12.2 so it could be enjoyed in a more modern Minecraft game. I will not be porting it beyond 1.12.2.</p>
		<h2><a href="https://fredtargaryen.github.io/files/ExRollerCoaster-1.5.1.jar?raw=true">Download the Port</a></h2>

		<p>The aim of the port is/was to faithfully port the existing ExRollerCoaster 1.7.10 content, while adding new content that might be enjoyable.</p>
		<p>Due to Forge having moved on from 1.12.2, and frankly getting bored with it, maintaining this mod is very low priority for me, but pull requests are welcome.</p>
